# Bestamus Prime
Code to control my cabinet/desktop actuator project used with the Arduino IDE. Designed using an ESP32 and it's built-in touch sensors as inputs. Button functions are as follows:
- Up
- Down
- Memory position 1
- Memory position 2
- Save position
- Automatic program (to move desk up/down every minutes)

DISCLAIMER: I have extremely limited coding experience, so use at your own risk.

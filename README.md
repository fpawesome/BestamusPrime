# Bestamus Prime
Code to control my cabinet/desktop actuator project used with the Arduino IDE. Designed using an ESP32 and it's built-in touch sensors as inputs. Button functions are as follows:
- Up
- Down
- Memory position 1
- Memory position 2
- Save current position to memory
- Automatic program (to move desk up/down between memory positions every 60 minutes)

Additional features:
- Debugging output to OLED display
- OLED animations when moving up/down
- Musical tones played on buzzer when moving to memory position (Harry Potter theme)

DISCLAIMER: I have extremely limited coding experience, so use at your own risk.
